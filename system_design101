System design basics 

- Scalability is the capability of a system, process, or a network to grow and manage increased demand
- We can scale using Horizontal ( Adding more servers ) or Vertical ( Increasing the compute power of server) 
- Horizontal scaling - MongoDB and Cassandra where as Vertical scaling is by MySql and it has some downtime 
- Reliability is the probability a system will fail in a given period
- Availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period
- To understand how to measure the efficiency of a distributed system, let’s assume we have an operation that runs in a distributed manner and delivers a set of items as result. Two standard measures of its efficiency are the response time (or latency) that denotes the delay to obtain the first item and the throughput (or bandwidth) which denotes the number of items delivered in a given time unit (e.g., a second).
- Another important consideration while designing a distributed system is how easy it is to operate and maintain. Serviceability or manageability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained; if the time to fix a failed system increases, then availability will decrease
- Early detection of faults can decrease or avoid system downtime. For example, some enterprise systems can automatically call a service center (without human intervention) when the system experiences a system fault.
