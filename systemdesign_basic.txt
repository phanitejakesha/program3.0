System Design Interviews: A step by step guide

1. Requirements Clarification

Clarify functional + non-functional requirements and narrow the scope of what you will design.

2. API / System Interface Definition

Define the endpoints (input/output) to make the system’s contract explicit.

3. Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation

Estimate scale: QPS, storage, bandwidth, traffic patterns.

4. Data Model Definition

Identify entities, relationships, and choose the appropriate database systems.

5. High-Level Architecture

Draw and explain a 5–7 component diagram covering all major system blocks.

6. Deep Dive Into Key Components

Pick 2–3 important components and discuss tradeoffs, alternatives, and optimizations.

7. Identify Bottlenecks & Resolve Them

Address single points of failure, scaling limits, caching strategy, replication, and monitoring.
